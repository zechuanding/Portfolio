<h3>EECS 494 Project 1: Reproduction of the 1986 The Legend of Zelda and extra custom levels!</h3>
<p>Tool: Unity, C#</p>
<p>Description: I worked on this project with teammate. I contributed to many room elements and dungeon layout, as well as enemies such as stalfos, goriya, and gel. I implemented some weapons and HUD for the game. For the custom levels, I created several interesting puzzle rooms. Hope you will like our game.</p>

<h3>EECS 494 Project 2: Metroidvania game Kazamatsuri Quest</h3>
<p>Tool: Unity, C#, Pixel Studio</p>
<p>Description: This a platformer, but you need to create platforms by yourself!</p>
<p>The platforms are not free: it costs your MP when creating one, so you may have to think before you start moving!</p>
<p>Use your paltforms to get over obstacles, avoid deadly lasers, and fight with boss.</p>
<p>I developed this mini Metroidvania on my own. I also designed almost all the pixel arts for the game. </p>
