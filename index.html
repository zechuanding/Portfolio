<p>EECS 494 Project 1: Reproduction of the 1986 The Legend of Zelda and Extra custom levels!<p>
<p>Tool: Unity, C#</p>
<p>Description: I worked on this project with teammate Ishita. I contributed to many room elements and dungeon layout, as well as enemies such as stalfos, goriya, and gel. I implemented some weapons and HUD for the game. For the custom levels, I created several interesting puzzle rooms. Hope you will like our game.</p>
